                        <h3>What Is Yoga?</h3><br>
                        <p class="fs-5">More than a physical workout, yoga is a full mind and body exercise.<br><br>A
                            set of specific exercises, called poses, combined with specific breathing techniques and
                            meditation principles are the building blocks of a yoga class. If a pose causes pain or
                            proves too difficult, there are variations and modifications that can be made to help
                            students. Props like blocks, blankets and straps — even chairs — can be used to help you get
                            the most benefit from the poses. Yoga is not one-size-fits-all: The best yoga workout for
                            you will depend on your individual needs and goals.<br><br>
                            The benefits of a regular yoga practice are wide-ranging. In general, a completeyoga workout
                            can help keep your back and joints healthy, improve your overallposture, stretch and
                            strengthen muscles and improve your balance, says RogerCole, Ph.D., a psychobiologist and
                            certified Iyengar yoga teacher. Yoga also has“a restorative side that is deeply relaxing and
                            rejuvenating,” Dr. Cole says.“Relaxation is built into every yoga session.”<br><br>In addition, yoga's focus on the breath can calm you and help you learn to be more mindful
                            of your body, says Dr. Timothy McCall, the author of “Yoga as Medicine,” and that can help
                            you to move with greater ease. <br><br>In recent years, more and more research is demonstrating the wide-ranging health benefits of
                            yoga.</p>
